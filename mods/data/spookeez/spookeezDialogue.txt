bf:thinking:Hey...
bf:awkward:It feels like we've been walking for a while, where are we going?
bf:awkward:This place seems weird.
gf:awkward:I could've sworn there were two kids singing here usually... seems like they're not here today.
bf:zone out:Kids...?
bf:awkward:You want me to go against children?
gf:serious:Don't underestimate them! They're actually really good even though they're so young. Although I wouldn't exactly say that they could beat me.
gf:normal:So, I'm gonna have you go against them!
gf:happy:Y'know, for more practice.
bf:relieved:I've already gone against your pops, there's no need to.
bf:normal:He was also skilled, wasn't he?
gf:serious2:Don't let it get to your head, my dad isn't as good at it anyways.
gf:happy:So, you're going to practice more by going against those kids.
gf:normal:After all, I'm responsible for teaching you, and it's also my responsibility to help you sing better!
bf:thinking:Alright, alright... thanks...
gf:happy2:Oh, look, there they are!
aside: :(GF waves at the kids' arrival.)
kids:hi:Hi Girlfriend!
gf:happy2:Skid! Pump! Good to see you two.
pump:surprised:Oh he's... 
pump:playful:Are you both seeing eachother?
gf:awkward:U-um...
gf:awkward2:A-anyways! I have a favor to ask of you both.
skid:blep:What is it?
gf:normal:Well, would you kids like to play with him?
bf:confused2:Is this a playdate now? -
aside: :(BF gets cut off by the kids)
kids:hi:Can we?!
pump:worried:But I'm kind of worried...
skid:confused2:Is it about the woman?
pump:worried2:Mm-hmm.
gf:awkward:Aw, does that mean you both can't?
pump:happy:Well... maybe it'll be okay if we do it secretly!
skid:happy:Yeah! Letâ€™s just not get found out by her.
bf:confused2:Hey... who's this woman you guys are talking about?
skid:normal:Oh, d-don't worry about it!
