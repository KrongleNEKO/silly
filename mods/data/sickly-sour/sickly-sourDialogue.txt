kids:hi:We got an idea!
pump:normal:Let's call our good ol' pal!
skid:normal:His name is Moloch!
bf:confused2:Uh- who???
skid:happy:Watch!
aside: :(The kids pull out a Ouija board, seemingly making out words with it)
gf:awkward&bgm:Are you... summoning a demon?
pump:happy2:Yeah! How'd you know?
gf:awkward:Is the demon good?
skid:happy:Moloch is our good friend! Of course, they're good!
pump:normal:We should be done!
aside: :(The Ouija board starts to react, and a large red demon emerged from the object)
bf:afraid3:Wh-what's going on?!
kids:hi:Moloch!
moloch:angry:Not you kids again!
moloch:surprised:What the- what is that?
bf:thinking:Yeah, we uh... got a problem...
moloch:surprised2:There's two of them...?
moloch:surprised3:Did it consume someone?
gf:awkward:Can you communicate with it? Talk it out or... something!
aside: :(Moloch attempts to talk to the being, but no reply was given)
pump:excited:We didn't know you can speak other languages, Moloch!
skid:excited:Yeah, can you teach us?
moloch:speechless:Don't even think about it.
moloch:surprised4:Well, it doesn't seem to respond.
moloch:surprised3:What, do you want me to kill it?
bf:awkward:I mean- it's able to sing with us?
moloch:speechless2:I don't even know what it is.
moloch:oh:That... thing isn't even doing anything. It's beyond my comprehension.
gf:angry2:Hold on a second... something's happening to it!
gf:serious:It's- wait... is that...?
bf:afraid3:...It became the lady.
bf:confused2:But something feels wrong... she feels... different.
skid:confused:M-mom...?
pump:afraid:It's Ms. Lila!
pump:afraid2:It really is her!
skid:confused:But I thought she's at home...?
lila:sweat&bgmFade:Kids... let's go home...

aside: :(The creature as it takes part of Lila's form bared it's fangs, and her eyes and gums were suddenly bloodied, turning into a similar look to the monster before.)

skid:angry3:My mom isn't scary!
aside: :(Skid and Pump had been taken hostage by the being)
kids:afraid:Help us!
