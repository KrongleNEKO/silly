lila:worried:Kids! There you are!
lila:worried2:Where were you going?

skid:angry2:She said she was my mom, but my mom's different from her!
skid:angry:For some reason she seems familiar too...
skid:angry2:But I still don't trust her! She could be a SCARY kid-eating monster!
gf:awkward:This lady... did she do anything to you?
lila:worried3:Kids... what's going on?
lila:worried2:I've been looking for you for the last few days, but you've just been running from me.

lila:worried:Kids, how about we go home? Okay?
